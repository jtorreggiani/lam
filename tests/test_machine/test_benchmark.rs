/// Benchmark test for the LAM.
///
/// This test repeatedly executes a small program that performs arithmetic evaluation
/// via the `ArithmeticIs` instruction. The program evaluates the expression (3 + 4) * 2,
/// which should yield 14. By running the program many times, we get an approximate measure
/// of the performance of the LAMâ€™s core instruction dispatch and arithmetic evaluation.
///
/// Note:
/// - In a more advanced system, you might implement a recursive loop entirely within the LAM.
///   Here, we simply reinitialize and run the same small program many times.
/// - This benchmark serves as a baseline for performance before further optimizations.
